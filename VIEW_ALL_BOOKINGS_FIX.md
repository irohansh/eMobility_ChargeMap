# View All Bookings Button - Fix Summary

## Problem
The "View All Bookings" button in the dashboard Quick Actions section was not working properly. It attempted to scroll to a bookings section but didn't always succeed.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Functionality
1. **Refresh Bookings**: Always reloads the latest bookings data
2. **Smooth Scroll**: Uses `scrollIntoView` with smooth animation
3. **Better Positioning**: Uses `block: 'center'` to center the bookings section in view
4. **User Feedback**: Shows a toast notification with booking count
5. **Proper Timing**: Added 100ms delay to ensure DOM is ready after reload

### Technical Changes

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
onClick={() => {
  const bookingsElement = document.querySelector('[data-bookings-section]');
  bookingsElement?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
}}
```

**After:**
```typescript
onClick={() => {
  loadBookings();
  setTimeout(() => {
    const bookingsElement = document.querySelector('[data-bookings-section]');
    if (bookingsElement) {
      bookingsElement.scrollIntoView({ 
        behavior: 'smooth', 
        block: 'center',
        inline: 'nearest'
      });
      toast({
        title: "Viewing Bookings",
        description: `You have ${bookings.length} total booking${bookings.length !== 1 ? 's' : ''}.`,
      });
    }
  }, 100);
}}
```

## Improvements

### 1. Data Freshness

### 4. Proper Timing
