## User Flow

1. **User opens Stations page**
   - System requests current location (geolocation API)
   - Shows nearby stations based on location

2. **User selects a station**
   - Clicks "Book Now"
   - Modal opens with date/time selection
   - Default dates are pre-filled (current date + 30 minutes)

3. **User fills booking form**
   - Selects charger
   - Adjusts date/time if needed
   - Adds vehicle information (optional)
   - Clicks "Book Session"

4. **System creates booking**
   - Calculates amount ($5 per hour)
   - Saves booking with "pending" payment status
   - Sends booking confirmation email
   - Shows payment option

5. **User makes payment**
   - Clicks "Pay Now" button
   - Stripe checkout opens
   - User enters card details
   - Payment is processed

6. **Payment confirmation**
   - Payment status updated to "paid"
   - Payment confirmation email sent
   - Booking appears on dashboard as "Paid"
   - User can view booking details

7. **Dashboard Display**
   - Bookings shown with payment status
   - "Pending" - needs payment
   - "Paid" - payment complete
   - Action buttons based on status

## Email Confirmations

### 1. Booking Confirmation
- Sent when booking is created
- Contains station details, times, and vehicle info
- Does NOT require payment

### 2. Payment Confirmation
- Sent when payment is processed
- Contains payment details, amount, and booking info
- Confirms booking is fully active

## Payment Flow Details

### Credit Card Payment Process:
1. User creates booking (no payment required yet)
2. User clicks "Pay Now" in dashboard
3. Frontend calls `/api/payments/create-intent`
4. Backend creates Stripe payment intent
5. Frontend receives client secret
6. Frontend renders Stripe Elements (card form)
7. User enters card details
8. Stripe processes payment
9. Frontend calls `/api/payments/confirm`
10. Backend confirms payment with Stripe
11. Payment and booking status updated
12. Confirmation email sent
13. User sees "Paid" status on dashboard

## Pricing Model
- **Rate**: $5 per hour
- **Minimum**: 1 hour
- **Calculation**: Hours = Ceiling((endTime - startTime) / 1 hour)
- **Example**: 1.5 hours = 2 hours = $10

## Security Features
- JWT authentication required for all booking/payment operations
- Stripe PCI compliance for card handling
- Server-side payment confirmation
- User authorization checks
- Secure API endpoints
