# React-Leaflet Version Compatibility Fix

## Problem
react-leaflet version 5.0.0 requires React 19, but the project uses React 18.3.1, causing peer dependency conflicts.

## Solution
Downgraded react-leaflet from v5 to v4.2.1, which is compatible with React 18.

## Changes Made

### 1. Uninstalled react-leaflet v5
```bash
npm uninstall react-leaflet
```

### 2. Installed Compatible Version
```bash
npm install react-leaflet@4.2.1
```

### 3. Installed TypeScript Types
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/leaflet
```

## Version Compatibility

### Before:
- react-leaflet: 5.0.0 (requires React 19)
- Project React: 18.3.1
- **Status:** ❌ Incompatible

### After:
- react-leaflet: 4.2.1 (compatible with React 18)
- Project React: 18.3.1
- **Status:** ✅ Compatible

## Differences Between v4 and v5

### API Changes (Minimal):
- Both versions use same MapContainer API
- Marker and Popup components are the same
- TileLayer and Circle work the same way
- No changes needed to our code

### TypeScript Support:
- v4: Uses `@types/leaflet` for types
- v5: Built-in TypeScript types
- We're using @types/leaflet with v4

## Code Compatibility

### Our OpenStreetMap Component:
✅ Works with both v4 and v5
✅ No API changes needed
✅ Same import structure
✅ Same component usage

### Import Statement:
```typescript
import { MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup, Circle } from 'react-leaflet';
```
Works with both versions.

## Testing

### Check Installation:
```bash
npm list react-leaflet
```
Should show: `react-leaflet@4.2.1`

### Verify No Conflicts:
```bash
npm install
```
Should complete without errors about React versions.

## Benefits of v4.2.1
